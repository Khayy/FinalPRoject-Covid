<h1>Use Case</h1>
<p>Through this app, users will have the opportunity to explore the effects of coronavirus (COVID-19) in the United States of America by various grouping variables and outcomes as of November 20, 2020. As we near the end of 2020 COVID-19 cases are on the rise again in the United States and understanding the effects by state can help you make informed decisions about your own wellbeing. (Mayo Clinic Staff, 2020). As we know there are many potential contributing factors to COVID-19 and this app will help you investigate some of those factors, such as pre-existing conditions, which we have seen affect COVID-19 progression (Ssentongo et al., 2020). This app is intended to answer questions about differences in COVID-19 occurrences and deaths by characteristics that might affect the user such as location (by state), gender, age, and pre-existing conditions. This app is not intended to predict or inform individuals specifically about themselves, this app is intended to inform users on overall rates by specific characteristics. This app will allow individuals to visualize and analyze COVID-19 cases and deaths across the United States. Users can investigate coronavirus through exploring COVID positive results, progression to extreme medical attention (individuals on ventilators), and death rates through several other factors (age, sex, location by state and pre-existing conditions). Additionally, users will be able to look at the general population statistics for the country and each state to better understand the impact COVID has had on the population. This app allows users to investigate COVID-19 in the United States with data collected between February 2020 and the end of November 2020. (Scott, 2020). This app is intended for individuals from the general population to use, with little background in statistical analysis and data visualization. This app is intended to be a user interface for individuals from any background, with an understanding of the English language, to investigate COVID-19 in the United States of America. Some background on statistical analysis (specifically analysis of variance) would be beneficial to the user but is not required due to the explanations and links to other resources provided within the app on how to interpret the analysis. This app will allow users to investigate COVID-19’s impact on the United States of America through three key ways: data exploration, data visualization, statistical analysis of group variations.</p>

<div id="required-packages" class="section level1">
<h1>Required Packages</h1>
<p><strong>Required packages:</strong><br /> shiny (version 1.5.0) <br /> shinythemes (version 1.1.2)<br /> fresh (version 0.2.0)<br /> tidyverse (version 1.3.0)<br /> broom (version 0.7.0)<br /> sf (version 0.9-6)<br /> tigris (version 1.0)<br /> leaflet (version 2.0.3)<br /> viridis (version 0.5.1)<br /></p>
<p>This shiny app was made using the shiny package, version 1.5.0. This package was used to design the app, as well as used in the creation of all statistical analyses, maps and graphs. This package is the backbone that allows this app to run. In addition, shinythemes package version 1.1.2 was used to help create the aesthetics of the app. The fresh package, version 0.2.0, was also used to help with the theme of the overall app. Another package that was used was the tidyverse package version 1.3.0. This package was used in the cleaning and preparing o f the data. Furthermore, the broom package version 0.7.0 was used. In this app, the broom package was used to tidy the output from the statistical analyses to make it easier to read. Next, the sf package, version 0.9-6, and the tigris package, version 1.0, were both used to help create the geographical mapping of the United States. In creating the interactive map, the leaflet package, version 2.0.3, was used to aid in this process. Finally, the viridis package, version 0.5.1, was used to color the map made by the leaflet package.</p>

<div id="data-source-and-structure" class="section level1">
<h1>Data Source and Structure</h1>
<p>One of the data sources used in this project comes from The COVID Tracking Project. This project is comprised from volunteers from <em>The Atlantic</em>. These volunteers have the goal of collecting and publishing data related to the coronavirus pandemic specifically in the United States. This data source contains information regarding number of deaths, number of cases, number of tests, and more. Structurally, this data collects information for each of the 50 U.S. states, the District of Columbia, and 5 U.S. territories. Each observation is in terms of days. What this means is that, each day, 56 new observations get added to the data set representing the COVID data from each of the 56 states/territories tracked. This means that there are a total of 14,730 observations with the first data being reported on January 22 (The COVID Tracking Project, 2020).</p>
<p>Another data source used comes from Ballotpedia. This source gives information on the political party of each of the state governors, including the governors of 5 U.S. territories. In terms of structure, this data has one row for each state/U.S. territory. In this row, there is the name of the state, the state abbreviation, and the party the governor belongs to (Ballotpedia, 2020).</p>
<p>Another source used is from the U.S. Census. This source contains information regarding the population of the United States broken down by state. This source also contains information for the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. In terms of structure, each state has its own row. In addition, the District of Columbia has a row, as does Puerto Rico. Furthermore, there is a row for the United States overall, and four different regions: Northeast, Midwest, South, and West. Each row contains information regarding the population from 2010 to 2019. Each row has the population totals for each of those 10 years, the percent increase over the years, number of deaths, births, etc. For a complete list of the variables in this data set, please consult the data dictionary <a href="https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/technical-documentation/file-layouts/2010-2019/nst-est2019-alldata.pdf">here</a>. (U.S. Census Bureau, 2019)</p>
<p>An additional data source used in this app is another source from the Center for Disease Control (CDC), specifically the National Center for Health Statistics. This source contains specifications on COVID-19 deaths broken down by state, age and gender. Age is separated into 10 groups, starting with a group of 18 – 29 and ending with a group of 85 and over. State is separated into the 50 states and includes the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. Gender is split into two genders: male and female. This data set additional has total counts for the entire country. In terms of structure this data source has 20 rows for each state with separate rows by age group and by gender. The cleaned data set used in this app includes 4 columns for state, gender, age group and total deaths. For more information about this data source and the CDC data collection , please consult the following link <a href="https://data.cdc.gov/NCHS/Provisional-COVID-19-Death-Counts-by-Sex-Age-and-S/9bhg-hcku">here</a>.

<div id="eda-inputs-controls-and-outputs" class="section level1">
<h1>EDA Inputs, Controls, and Outputs</h1>
<p>Users will be able to explore COVID-19 in the United States by looking at the overall distribution of deaths in the country by a selection of variables; age, pre-existing conditions, COVID-19 testing status and an overall COVID-19 deaths visualization. Age, condition and COVID-19 exploration will be visualized through bar graphs showing the distribution of deaths by the selection criteria. COVID-19 Status will be displayed through line graphs showing the distribution over time. From these overall graphs, users will be able to gain some base knowledge before you dive in deeper into the app. This page is intended to give users background knowledge on general information relating to COVID-19 in the United States. Additionally, users will have the opportunity to explore COVID-19 at the individual state level in each of the 50 states and Washington, DC and Puerto Rico. Users will have the opportunity to look at specific age groups, gender and the change over time of COVID-19 deaths, positive cases and negative cases in each of the 50 states and Washington, DC and Puerto Rico. Pre-existing conditions relation to deaths in each state will be visualized through a bar graph as will age by deaths in each state. For COVID-19 deaths, positive cases, negative cases over time for each state, a line graph will be used to visualize the data.</p>
<p>You will be able to visualize compare confirmed cases and deaths due to COVID-19 by age, by gender, by pre-existing conditions, by month, and by state in the United States. These will be visualized in two ways. First, you will be able to look at boxplots comparing the distribution of COVID-19 deaths for each group in the variable. In addition, you will also be able to look at bar graphs to look at which group has the most COVID-19 cases. You will also be able to visually investigate the relationship of age, existing conditions, and location (by state) to total COVID positive test results, extreme progression of the virus (individuals on ventilators), and COVID deaths. You will be able to see these relations through boxplots to get a sense of the distribution, and bar graphs to get a sense of the total numbers. For each of the boxplots created you will have the choice whether to perform a log transformation of the data to get a better sense of the distribution. In addition, there are histograms presented for the overall distribution of COVID-19 deaths, positive test results, and extreme progression of the virus (individuals on ventilators).</p>
<p>Furthermore, you will be able to look at COVID-19 related facts on a map. On this map, you can choose whether to visualize COVID-19 deaths, number of positive test results, or number of negative test results. Once you select which of those three you would like to explore, a map of the United States will appear, where each state is a different shade of red. The darker shade of red the state is, the more of that input there is. For example, if you choose “death” as what you would like to explore, the darker shade of red a state is the more deaths there are in that state compared to the other states. It is important to note that these are totals for the entire pandemic, not for specific months. In addition, if you were to click on any state on the map, the name of the state, as well as the number for that state would be presented. On the map, you can choose to zoom in, zoom out, or move around more to focus on specific regions/states as needed. In addition, you can choose whether the map resents the total numbers, or the numbers per 100,000 people. The numbers per 100,000 people will make comparing states to each other easier, because it accounts for the population of people in that state.</p>
</div>
<div id="statistical-analysis-inputs-controls-and-outputs" class="section level1">
<h1>Statistical Analysis Inputs, Controls, and Outputs</h1>
<p>Within this app, users will have the opportunity to conduct several statistical analyses on the data previously described. This will include Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and t-tests.</p>
<p>For the ANOVA, users will be able to conduct both one-way and two-way ANOVAs to investigate if there is a statistically significant difference in COVID outcomes in the general population and within the population who have pre-existing conditions, which we know have a relationship to COVID outcomes (Ssentongo et al., 2020). Users will be directed to the following link if interested to learn more about ANOVA analysis within the field of medicine and health: <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/nursing-and-health-professions/analysis-of-variance" class="uri">https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/nursing-and-health-professions/analysis-of-variance</a>. This analysis will help users answer the question of if there is a significant difference between COVID-19 deaths between various groups of individuals. This will inform them if there are significantly higher/lower deaths compared to other groups. For example, an individual can conduct an ANOVA on age to see if there is a significant difference between age groups and total COVID-19 deaths. This can inform them if certain age groups have higher/lower deaths than others.</p>
<p>To conduct this analysis users will go to two tabs. Statistical Analysis for each population can be found on separate tabs within the app but consist of the same overall design just with different data sources to focus on either the general population or a more specific population. On each tab, users will first be able to select which type of ANOVA they would like to conduct (one-way or two-way). Then users will have the opportunity to select one or two (depending on ANOVA type) grouping variables by which they can conduct their ANOVA on. For the general population grouping variables consist of age, gender, and location (by state). For the pre-existing condition population grouping variable consist of age, gender, location (by state), specific condition (titled condition on app), overall condition type (titled condition group on app). The outcome variable of interest for both tabs of statistical analysis will be COVID-19 deaths. Once a user has selected their input options, the app will output an ANOVA analysis summary including the degrees of freedom, sum or squares, mean of squares, F value, p-value and a designation for if it is a significant result for each grouping variable.</p>
<p>Users should interpret ANOVA results through the output of the p-value and subsequently the significance of the test. Interpretation of a significant value within this app will inform the user that there is a significant difference between their grouping variable in terms of COVID-19 deaths. A non-significant finding will suggest that there is not a significant difference between their grouping variable in terms of COVID-19 deaths. Additionally, a boxplot grouping by their selected grouping variables will be shown for the user to visually represent and summarized what their analysis is telling them. Boxplots will visually show the distribution of the data and subsequently show if the groups are similarly distributed or have variations between them. It is important for the user to note, that while the boxplots may visually look different from each other, the ANOVA analysis is what can actually tell you if they are significantly different from each other.</p>
<p>Based on the input you choose for the mapping, different t-tests will be run. They will compare whether the political party of state’s governors affect the number of COVID-19 deaths, positive test results, or negative test results. Whichever you choose to visualize on the map of the United States will be the same variable used in this t-test. The app presents the p-value, estimate, and 95% confidence interval from the t-test. If the p-value is below 0.05, then there is evidence that the political party of the governor affects the input variable, and you can conclude that the estimate is statistically different than 0. In addition, you can conclude with 95% confidence that the true value of the input falls between the lower and upper bounds of the 95% confidence interval. If you choose to do the mapping per 100,000 people, the t-test changes slightly. The interpretation and baseline concepts discussed above are still applicable. However, the numbers will be per 100,000 people. Therefore, the interpretation will change and your conclusions will be made for 100,000 people.</p>
