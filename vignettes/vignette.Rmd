# Data Source and Structure

One of the data sources used in this project comes from The COVID Tracking Project. This project is comprised from volunteers from *The Atlantic*. These volunteers have the goal of collecting and publishing data related to the coronavirus pandemic specifically in the United States. This data source contains information regarding number of deaths, number of cases, number of tests, and more. Structurally, this data collects information for each of the 50 U.S. states, the District of Columbia, and 5 U.S. territories. Each observation is in terms of days. What this means is that, each day, 56 new observations get added to the data set representing the COVID data from each of the 56 states/territories tracked. This means that there are a total of 14,730 observations with the first data being reported on January 22 (Our Data, 2020).

Another data source used comes from Ballotpedia. This source gives information on the political party of each of the state governors, including the governors of 5 U.S. territories. In terms of structure, this data has one row for each state/U.S. territory. In this row, there is the name of the state and the party the governor belongs to (Partisan Composition of Governors, 2020).

# EDA Inputs, Controls, and Outputs

You will be able to visualize compare confirmed cases and deaths due to COVID-19 by age, by gender, by pre-existing conditions, by month, and by state in the United States. These will be visualized in two ways. First, you will be able to look at boxplots comparing the distribution of COVID-19 deaths for each group in the variable. In addition, you will also be able to look at bar graphs to look at which group has the most COVID-19 cases. You will also be able to visually investigate the relationship of age, existing conditions, and location (by state) to total COVID positive test results, extreme progression of the virus (individuals on ventilators), and COVID deaths. You will be able to see these relations through boxplots to get a sense of the distribution, bar graphs to get a sense of the total numbers, and a written summary output generated for each visualization. For each of the boxplots created you will have the choice as to whether include outliers in the graph or not. If you choose to not include outliers, you can change the maximum value of the x-axis to make the graph easier to read. In addition, there are boxplots presented for the overall distribution of COVID-19 deaths, positive test results, and extreme progression of the virus (individuals on ventilators). 

Furthermore, you will be able to look at COVID-19 related facts on a map. On this map, you can choose whether to visualize COVID-19 deaths, number of positive test results, or number of negative test results. Once you select which of those three you would like to explore more, a map of the United States will appear, where each state is a different shade of red. The darker shade of red the state is, the more of that input there is. For example, if you choose "death" as what you would like to explore, the darker shade of red a state is the more deaths there are in that state compared to the other states. It is important to note that these are totals for the entire pandemic, not for specific months. In addition, if you were to click on any state on the map, the name of the state, as well as the number for that state would be presented. On the map, you can choose to zoom in, zoom out, or move around more to focus on specific regions/states as needed. 

# Statistical Analysis Inputs, Controls, and Outputs

Based on the input you choose for the mapping, different t-tests will be run. They will compare whether the political party of state's governors affect the number of COVID-19 deaths, positive test results, or negative test results. Whichever you choose to visualize on the map of the United States will be the same variable used in this t-test. The app presents the p-value, estimate, and 95% confidence interval from the t-test. If the p-value is below 0.05, then there is evidence that the political party of the governor affects the input variable, and you can conclude that the estimate is statistically different than 0. In addition, you can conclude with 95% confidence that the true value of the input falls between the lower and upper bounds of the 95% confidence interval.
